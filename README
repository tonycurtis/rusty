The top-level "do-gen" script parses an OpenSMHEM header file and
generates derived Rust equivalents.  Note this is pretty raw output
and is not something that Rust programmers would want to see.

The do-gen output goes into the shmemlib project.

The shmem project builds on shmemlib and implements Rust code that
hides all the unsafe operations that result from parsing the C.  Or at
least, this is the idea, and where the work will be.

The other projects (directories) are example programs to explore how
to actually use OpenSHMEM with Rust and to see what the interface
should look like.  Currently it is too "C-like", e.g. see rotput that
requires unsafe operations in user code.  This should be hidden by the
shmem library.

The examples are taken from the C and C++ programs in:
